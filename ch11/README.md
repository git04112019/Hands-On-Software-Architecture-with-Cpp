# Building and Packaging

## Building

To build this project out of source, run:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
conan install .. --build=missing
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

## Installing

Run `cmake --install .` to install the software into `${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}`. If no prefix is given, it will install
 system-wide. To change this, add `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/install/to` to your cmake invocation.

## Packaging

Run `cpack`. Simple as that. Assuming you're running on a system supporting DEB packages, you'll get a .tar.gz file
, a .zip file, and a .deb package.

## Building a Conan package

In the build directory, run `cmake --build . --target conan`.

## Building a Docker container

In the build directory, run `cmake --build . --target docker`.
